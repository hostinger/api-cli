## hostinger mail orders plan

Get order plan

### Synopsis

Retrieve the plan the given mail order was purchased with, including
domain-level and mailbox-level quotas, limits, and protocol
availability.

The order can be given as [order-id] or left out, in which case it comes from --order-id, HOSTINGER_ORDER_ID, the .hostinger/site.json written by `hostinger up` or `hostinger link` (hosting orders), or a prompt when run in a terminal (the only order is used without asking).
