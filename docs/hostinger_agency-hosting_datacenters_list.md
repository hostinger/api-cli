## hostinger agency-hosting datacenters list

List available datacenters

### Synopsis

Lists the datacenters available for provisioning a new website on the given Agency Plan
hosting order.

Each datacenter includes a `pinger_url` you can ping from the client to measure round-trip
latency; comparing the results across datacenters lets you pick the nearest one (lowest
ping) before choosing its `code` as the `datacenter_code` when creating a website setup.
