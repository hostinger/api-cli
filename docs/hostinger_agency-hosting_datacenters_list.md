## hostinger agency-hosting datacenters list

List available datacenters

### Synopsis

Lists the datacenters available for provisioning a new website on the given Agency Plan
hosting order.

Each datacenter includes a `pinger_url` you can ping from the client to measure round-trip
latency; comparing the results across datacenters lets you pick the nearest one (lowest
ping) before choosing its `code` as the `datacenter_code` when creating a website setup.

The order can be given as [order-id] or left out, in which case it comes from --order-id, HOSTINGER_ORDER_ID, the .hostinger/site.json written by `hostinger up` or `hostinger link` (hosting orders), or a prompt when run in a terminal (the only order is used without asking).
