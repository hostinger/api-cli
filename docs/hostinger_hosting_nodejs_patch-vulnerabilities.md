## hostinger hosting nodejs patch-vulnerabilities

Patch Node.js vulnerabilities

### Synopsis

Patches the selected Node.js vulnerabilities by updating the affected package versions
in `package.json` and opening a GitHub pull request in the connected repository. The
customer reviews and merges the pull request; merging triggers the automatic deployment.

Auto-fix is only available for websites deployed from a connected GitHub repository.
Websites deployed from an archive have no auto-fix path and return a 404. The Hostinger
GitHub App needs write access to the repository; without it the request fails with a
403 explaining the missing permission.

Only vulnerabilities with `is_patchable` set to `true` can be patched. Non-patchable
IDs in the selection are skipped; the pull request covers the patchable subset, listed
in `patched_vulnerability_ids`. Selections without any patchable vulnerability are
rejected with a 422. Only one patch pull request can be open at a time per website;
close or merge it before patching again. Available on Business and Cloud Hosting plans.
