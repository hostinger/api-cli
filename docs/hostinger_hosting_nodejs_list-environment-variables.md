## hostinger hosting nodejs list-environment-variables

List Node.js environment variables

### Synopsis

Lists the Node.js environment variables currently set for the website. Values are always
masked as `********` and cannot be read back through this API. Use this endpoint to see
which keys are configured or to verify a change, not to read values.

To change variables, use the `Replace Node.js environment variables` endpoint. It replaces
the whole set, so never copy the masked values from this response into that request; send
the full desired set with real values taken from the project `.env` file or the user
prompt instead.

The website can be given as [domain] (the account username is looked up), as <username> <domain>, or left out, in which case it comes from --domain, HOSTINGER_DOMAIN, the .hostinger/site.json written by `hostinger up` or `hostinger link`, the default_domain in the config file, or a prompt when run in a terminal.

      --dry-run           Print the request as a curl command instead of sending it

      --jq string         Filter the JSON response with a jq expression, e.g. '.data[].id'
      --no-input          Never prompt; fail when an argument, flag or confirmation is missing
      --order-id string   Order for commands that act on an order (default: HOSTINGER_ORDER_ID, .hostinger/site.json for hosting, or a prompt)
