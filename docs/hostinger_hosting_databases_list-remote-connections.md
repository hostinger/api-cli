## hostinger hosting databases list-remote-connections

List database remote connections

### Synopsis

Returns the remote-access rules for the specified account: the remote hosts
(IPv4/IPv6 addresses, or "%" for any host) allowed to connect to the account databases.

Use the domain filter to only return rules for databases assigned to a specific domain.

The hosting account can be given as [username] or left out, in which case it comes from --username, HOSTINGER_USERNAME, the website named by --domain or HOSTINGER_DOMAIN, the .hostinger/site.json written by `hostinger up` or `hostinger link`, default_domain in the config file, or a prompt when run in a terminal.
